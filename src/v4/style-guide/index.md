# Style Guide

This is the official style guide for Everflow-specific code. If you use Everflow in a project, it’s a great reference to avoid errors, bikeshedding, and anti-patterns. However, we don’t believe that any style guide is ideal for all teams or projects, so mindful deviations are encouraged based on past experience, the surrounding tech stack, and personal values.

Finally, we've split rules into three categories:

## Rule Categories

### Priority A: Essential

These rules help prevent errors, so learn and abide by them at all costs. Exceptions may exist, but should be very rare and only be made by those with expert knowledge of both TypeScript, Vue and Everflow.

### Priority B: Strongly Recommended

These rules have been found to improve readability and/or developer experience in most projects. Your code will still run if you violate them, but violations should be rare and well-justified.

### Priority C: Recommended

Where multiple, equally good options exist, an arbitrary choice can be made to ensure consistency. In these rules, we describe each acceptable option and suggest a default choice. That means you can feel free to make a different choice in your own codebase, as long as you’re consistent and have a good reason. Please do have a good reason though! By adapting to the community standard, you will:
1. Train your brain to more easily parse most of the community code you encounter
2. Be able to copy and paste most community code examples without modification
3. Often find new hires are already accustomed to your preferred coding style, at least in regards to Everflow
